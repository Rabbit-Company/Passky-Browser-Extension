# Passky-Browser-Extension
## What is Passky?
Passky is simple password manager, which works on a zero trust architecture. That means only user will be able to decrypt his passwords. So users can safely store their passwords on any server. That means if a server on where all passwords are stored get hacked, hacker won't be able to decrypt passwords and data on this server will be useless for him.

Please be aware that this project is still work in progress.
